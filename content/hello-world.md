It’s already 2022, are blogs even still a thing?

I don’t know about you but, alongside YouTube videos, online blogs are my main source of news when it comes to web development. They are also an indispensable source of knowledge especially now that I’m exploring DevOps, Kubernetes, and a lot of related things. Those who came before me and documented their journey through their own blogs enabled me to emulate what they did and learn on my own from there.

This blog has the following goals:
- Document my experiments and lessons
- Share what I’ve learned
- Be a time capsule to remind me how much I’ve learned through the years

Will I meet any (and hopefully all) of those goals? Only time will tell.
